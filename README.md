# dockbegone

A simple tweak to remove the dock on iOS.
(Also my first tweak)

*Works on iOS 10... may work for other versions. (I can't test because of a lack of other devices)*

Do whatever you want with this tweak, its open for any reuse.

Constructive criticism and help is appreciated, I am a new dev.
